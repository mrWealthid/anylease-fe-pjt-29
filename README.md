PROJECT TITLE: Anylease    
TEAM 29 AnyLease

Description: A service that allows individuals and organizations to lease equipment for long or short term use. Value: It helps people make money off items and equipment that are idle or not in use.

Long term goal - To build a solution that allows individuals and organizations to lease equipment for long or short term use.
Expert session & HMWs - In the absence of readily available experts, we played their part after all we're the ones building the product so we could suffice. This involves discussions and asking different questions to tear down the problem that we're trying to fix by building the product(AnyLease). This led to our How Might Wes (HMWs). We came up with different HMWs but concluded that these 3 were top priority
How might we get across to potential users (leasers and people making use of the equipment);
How might users get to make use of our service or product?
How might we get or encourage feedback and continuity with our services?
Journey Map - This involves processes by which a user discovers our product or service, interacts with it and gets expected functions or solution(a three steps process, Discover, Steps, Outcome).
Discover - Users can discover our product through Google search, social media Ads, Word of mouth, and From reviews on other platforms.

Steps - To get started with our product, a user clicks on a link - sees catalogue of products or landing page - signs up - lease an equipment (these are interchangeable, see diagram below).
Outcome - Lease and equipment.

4 Part Sketch - Involved note taking, Doodling, crazy 8s before doing the actual sketch(done by our UI/UX designers ).
	

Storyboarding - We came up with different user Test flows then voted one of the user test flows. Below is the chosen Test flow

Step 1: User gets to our website after clicking an ad or link sent from a friend and gets directed to our homepage
Step 2: User sees a brief description of anyLease and sees a catalogue of products, user can also navigate through other catalogs
Step 3: User clicks on an item then gets redirected to signup where their details are saved.
step 4: User proceeds to pay(payment stays on our platform till equipment confirmation) 
Step 5: Users drop a review.
